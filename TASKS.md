## Memory Notes & Current Status

### Production Environment
- **Live URL**: https://restaurant-daily.mindweave.tech (HTTPS âœ…)
- **Fallback IP**: https://4.213.183.139
- **Process Manager**: PM2 (restaurant-daily process)
- **Web Server**: Nginx reverse proxy (port 443/80 â†’ 3000)
- **SSL Certificate**: Let's Encrypt with auto-renewal
- **Auto-restart**: Enabled via systemd service
- **Quality Gates**: Husky pre-push hooks (tests + lint + build)

### Tech Stack Decisions
- **Next.js 15.5.3**: Server-side rendering + static optimization
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **PM2**: Production process management and monitoring
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing (4/4 tests passing)
- **Zustand**: State management (lightweight Redux alternative)

### Authentication Strategy
- **Phone-based**: Primary authentication method
- **OTP Verification**: SMS/service-based verification
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management
- **Role-based Access**: Admin vs Team Member permissions
- **Mobile-first**: Optimized for restaurant staff using phones/tablets

### Current Development Focus
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Complete (Foundation + Deployment)
